# 🩺 ECG-Board-Dev

This project focuses on building and enhancing an Electrocardiogram (ECG) board and integrating it with software applications for real-world use cases.

## Overview

As a Software Engineering student passionate about bridging hardware and software, I soldered and assembled a fully functional ECG amplifier board. The board captures real ECG signals using basic electrode inputs and filters out noise with onboard analog circuitry.

##  What I Have Done So Far

-  Completed full PCB soldering and assembly based on provided schematics.
-  Successfully tested basic ECG signal output and noise filtering (using 60Hz notch filter and low-pass filters).
-  Verified operation through LED beat indicators and oscilloscope waveform readings.

##  Next Steps

- Connect the ECG board to a Raspberry Pi.
- 📈 Develop a software interface to simulate a patient chart, display real-time heart signals, and record data.
- 🖥️ Purchase and integrate a dedicated screen to display the live heartbeat dashboard directly from the Raspberry Pi.
- Apply AI/ML models to detect trends or anomalies in ECG patterns for early disease prediction.

## 🎯 Future Goals

- Build a live dashboard 🖥️ with real-time data visualization.
- Implement basic machine learning models to predict stroke risk or detect irregular heartbeats.
- Explore mobile 📱 and web integrations for remote health monitoring.
